Vision: 
The concept was to create a wiki for fans of the musician Mark Kozelek 
The original idea was to build a platform for collaborative discussion of the artist with a forum type feature. The intention for the design was to be minimal using greyscale and a visually uncluttered style. 

Intended core features: 
1. Articles about different projects the artist is associated with containing editable textual details 
2. An account of the number of words and characters displayed in the article text
3. A log text file which is appended each time the wiki is updated with details of changes made
4. A link to a sign-in page which allows a user to register to edit the wiki
5. A link to a login page which allows an administrator additional features to perform the following: a. override/remove changes to the details made by a user b. archive the details to a separate text file c. add/edit/delete additional users and change their access privileges  to edit details d. enable the wiki to be reset by the administrator to its initial default details 
 
Intended additional features: 
1. Message board feature to allow discussion of the site and artist
2. Link to album of the day
3. Random image displayed in header
 
 
Implemented core features: 
All of the intended core features were implemented.

Implemented additional features:
